[remediation]
recommendation = "Filter API responses to only include data fields that are explicitly required by the client application for the given context. Avoid relying on client-side filtering. Implement response filtering on the backend. Define clear data contracts (e.g., using OpenAPI schemas) for API responses and ensure they are enforced."
