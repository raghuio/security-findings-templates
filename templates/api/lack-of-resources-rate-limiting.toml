[remediation]
recommendation = "Implement rate limiting on API requests based on IP address, user account, or API key. Define acceptable request quotas and throttling policies. Set limits on request payload sizes, response sizes, and the number of records returned in a single request (enforce pagination). Implement timeouts for API requests. Monitor resource utilization and implement alerts for unusual consumption patterns."
