[remediation]
recommendation = "Avoid binding incoming data directly to internal objects. Use an allow-list approach (DTOs - Data Transfer Objects or ViewModels) to specify exactly which properties can be set by the client. Alternatively, use a deny-list for properties that should never be updated, but allow-lists are generally safer. Ensure that business logic, not just the client, dictates which properties can be modified."
