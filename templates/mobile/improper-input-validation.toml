[remediation]
recommendation = "Implement robust input validation on both client-side and server-side (if data is sent to a backend). Validate for type, length, format, and range. Use allow-lists for acceptable characters and patterns. Sanitize or encode data appropriately before it's used in sensitive contexts (e.g., SQL queries, HTML output in WebViews, file paths, commands). Be cautious with data received from IPC or custom URL schemes."
