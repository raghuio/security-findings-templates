[remediation]
recommendation = "Never hardcode credentials, API keys, or other secrets directly in the mobile application's code or configuration files. For server-side API keys, the mobile app should authenticate to a backend service, which then uses the API keys to communicate with third-party services. For user credentials, use secure authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth2) and store tokens securely using platform-provided secure storage (Keystore/Keychain). If client-side secrets are unavoidable (e.g., for some SDK initializations), ensure they have minimal privileges and consider using techniques like code obfuscation and runtime secret fetching from a secure server, though these are not foolproof."
