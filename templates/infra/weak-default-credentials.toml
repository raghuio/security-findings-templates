recommendation = "Change all default credentials immediately upon device/service deployment. Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, history, lockout after failed attempts). Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) wherever possible, especially for administrative access. Regularly audit for weak or default credentials. Disable or restrict access to unnecessary services and management interfaces."
