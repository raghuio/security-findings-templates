[remediation]
recommendation = "Implement a defense-in-depth network segmentation strategy. Isolate critical systems and sensitive data in dedicated network segments with strict access controls. Apply the principle of least privilege to network traffic, only allowing necessary communication between segments. Regularly review and audit firewall rules and network configurations. Use technologies like VLANs, firewalls, and Network Access Control (NAC) to enforce segmentation."
