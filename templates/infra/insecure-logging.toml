[remediation]
recommendation = "Avoid logging sensitive information. If logging such data is unavoidable for debugging, ensure it is masked or redacted. Implement proper access controls for log files and directories. Use centralized logging solutions that support secure log transmission (e.g., encrypted syslog, HTTPS for log shipping) and storage. Regularly review and audit log configurations and contents. Ensure log verbosity is appropriate for production environments (avoid excessive debug logging)."
