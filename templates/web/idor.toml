recommendation = "Implement robust access control checks on the server-side for every request that accesses an object. Verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the requested object. Avoid exposing direct database identifiers in URLs or requests; use indirect reference maps or session-based handling where possible. If direct references are used, ensure they are unpredictable (e.g., UUIDs) and always validated against the user's session."
