[remediation]
recommendation = "Implement access control mechanisms that enforce policies based on user roles and permissions. Deny access by default. Verify access controls on the server-side for every request. Ensure that identifiers for resources are not easily guessable or manipulable (e.g., use UUIDs instead of sequential IDs where appropriate)."
