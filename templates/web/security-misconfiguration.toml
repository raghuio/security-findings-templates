[remediation]
recommendation = "Implement a secure hardening process for all components. Regularly review and update configurations. Disable unnecessary features and services. Use strong, unique credentials and avoid defaults. Implement appropriate HTTP security headers. Ensure software is kept up-to-date with security patches. Restrict access to administrative interfaces and sensitive files."
